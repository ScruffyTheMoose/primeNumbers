Let \textit{p} be a prime number.

\textit{p} is a Germain Prime if $2\textit{p}+1$ is also prime.

Our objective was to identify exceptionally long sequences of Germain primes. To do so, we examined all primes up to $10^9$. On this interval, we found 14,156,112 Germain primes. The two longest sequences were found starting at 19099919 and 52554569 and had seven primes each.
