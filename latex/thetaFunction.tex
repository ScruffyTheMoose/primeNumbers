Chebyshev's First Function is defined as

$\theta(x) = \sum_{\textit{p} \leq x} \log(\textit{p})$

where \textit{p} is a prime number.

Because this function is a sum, the provided list of primes must include all primes less than or equal to the greatest prime in the given list. If all primes are not included, the resulting $\theta$(x) will not be accurate.

Because this is an arithmetic sequence, for each \textit{p}, we take its natural log and add it to the previously determined $\theta$(x).

The end result is a list of values for $\theta$(x).

Interestingly, the resulting curve produced by this function acts as a lower bound to the set of prime numbers which it represents. The curve is also log-linear, which allows for very loose approximation of prime numbers.

To demonstrate the relationship between $\theta(x)$ and x, here are some charts.
**ADD IMAGES HERE**.

The relative difference between $\theta(x)$ and x approaches 0 as x tends to infinity.
