For this sieve to function, we implement a sequence of smaller algorithms to parse out primes.

First, we remove any numbers on the interval that are multiples of smaller trivial primes. Prime Number Theorem estimates that the prime numbers found up to 10000 represent approximately 80\% (tbd idk what the true value is) of all possible primes. As such, removing these obvious composite numbers reduces the the number of numbers to test significantly.

We then push the remaining numbers through the Miller-Rabin test. This primaility test is probabalistic, but is extremely fast and has an error rate of approximately $2^{-128}$. This will effectively remove any composite numbers left.

Lastly, using the Fibonacci test, we identify deterministically which of the remaining numbers are true primes.

The High Sieve algorithm was built in order to more easily parse true prime numbers out of the non-trivial range, which is defined to be $[0, 10^{10}]$. The objective in doing so was to compare the quantities of primes found in the non-trivial range to the estimations provided by Prime Number Theorem.

The Prime Counting Function, $\pi(x)$, can be used to estimate the quantity of primes not greater than x using the formula $\frac{x}{\log{x}}$. 

We can then alter this formula to estimate the quantity of primes on an interval [x, x+k].

$\frac{x+k}{log(x+k)} - \frac{x}{log(x+k)}$

$\rightarrow$ $\frac{k}{log(x+k)}$\\

To test the estimates of $\pi(x)$ against this sieve, we looked at increasingly high intervals outside of the trivial range and compared the true number of primes to $\pi(x)$.

Here are the findings for the first one-million integers outside the trivial range in intervals where k=10000.
**ADD IMAGE HERE**

During continued testing, we found that the difference between $\pi(x)$ and the true prime count approaches zero as the lower bound for the interval tends to infinity.
